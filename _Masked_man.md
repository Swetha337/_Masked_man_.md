STEPS TO FOLLOW: <br/>
•	We were provided with an audio file as part of the challenge. 
•	To extract the hidden information, we uploaded the file to a tool called Audacity. 
•	By selecting the spectrogram view option, we converted the audio file into a spectrogram. 
•	Upon expanding the spectrogram, we discovered an image of Ryan Reynolds. 
•	The flag for this challenge is his birth date.
What did I learn:
I learned how to use Audacity, a tool for audio editing and analysis, to uncover hidden information within an audio file. 
By analyzing the spectrogram, you were able to discover hidden visual information, such as an image embedded in the audio file.
