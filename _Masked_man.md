STEPS TO FOLLOW: <br/>
•	We were provided with an audio file as part of the challenge. <br/>
•	To extract the hidden information, we uploaded the file to a tool called Audacity. <br/> 
•	By selecting the spectrogram view option, we converted the audio file into a spectrogram. <br/> 
•	Upon expanding the spectrogram, we discovered an image of Ryan Reynolds. <br/> 
•	The flag for this challenge is his birth date. <br/>
What did I learn: <br/>
I learned how to use Audacity, a tool for audio editing and analysis, to uncover hidden information within an audio file. <br/> 
By analyzing the spectrogram, you were able to discover hidden visual information, such as an image embedded in the audio file.
